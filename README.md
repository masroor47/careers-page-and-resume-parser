## Resume Parser

This is my resume parser project. It's made with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling and that's about it.

### Web App

The app has two pages: one for applicants and one for recruiters.

### Apply
On the "Apply" page you can complete a form and submit their resume (only .txt files for now lol).
### Dashboard
On the "Dashboard" page you can see all of the applications and resumes. 
Later this quarter we will ship a feature to sort, search and filter through keywords.

### To run this
First, install all packages:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```
Then run locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
(That's if npm run ran it on port 3000)
